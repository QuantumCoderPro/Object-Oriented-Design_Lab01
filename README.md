Object-Oriented Programming Concepts in Java

This repository contains sample Java programs that demonstrate key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The examples cover the following OOP principles:

**Encapsulation with Getters & Setters:**

Illustrates the use of **encapsulation** to protect the internal state of an object.
Includes getters and setters to access and modify private attributes.

**Inheritance:**

Demonstrates the concept of **inheritance**, where a subclass inherits properties and behaviors from a superclass.
Shows how a derived class can extend and specialize the functionality of a base class.

**Method Overriding & Method Overloading:**

Displays **method overriding**, where a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method defined in its superclass.

Introduces **method overloading**, showcasing how a class can have multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists.
Feel free to explore the code examples to gain a better understanding of these fundamental OOP concepts. Each example is accompanied by comments for clarity, making it beginner-friendly and educational for those learning Java or OOP principles
